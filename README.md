# Gittify (Alpha)
> Chrome extension forked from [Like on git](https://github.com/Idnan/like-on-git) to save links, and if you want, a local (limited) copy of their content.

It makes it seem-less to create "today-i-read" repository where you put all the links that you read or liked. Just click a button and the link will be committed to your repository under the current date.

## Installation

- Download the extension from [release page](https://github.com/Ale46/gittify/releases/) and [load it manually](http://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system/247654#247654)

## Setup

- First things, create a repository to which you would want the links to the liked content be added
- Right click the extension icon (thumb icon) in the bar and click the options page
- At the options page, add the specified details

## Info

- The markdown option works only with a readability token
- The markdown/text based page (html, php, asp) files only store text, other resources (images, video, css, js) are not pushed in the repository
- Other files (pdf, txt, etc.) should work fine
